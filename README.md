Yes: Run AutoRefresh Service\
No: Stop AutoRefresh Service\
Cancel : Exit the VBS

## Important Notes
SmoothScroll.exe needs to be running before launching the service\
Or else the service won't be able to find the origin location of SmoothScroll.exe

Save your CMD works before deactivate service!\
It will kill all **cmd.exe** and **conhost.exe** to eliminate memory leaks

Feedbacks are appreciated.
